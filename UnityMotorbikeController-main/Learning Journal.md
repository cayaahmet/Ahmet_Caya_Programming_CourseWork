I’ve started by researching bicycle/motorcycle physics assets because I want to do a delivery game prototype. I can add components such making deliveries, earning cash, timer and getting to certain locations to pick boxes etc. I've found a free online asset that contains a motorcycle physics asset/system which I am going to use and modify.

I want to make a delivery mission type of prototype where the player must go a given target destination to earn “points” or “money”. I can’t really find a tutorial for it so I will have to do it myself.

I will start this process by creating a script to spawn 3D cubes(areas) around the map to act as “delivery destinations”. This process will be carried out by the player clicking a button to get more deliveries. 


Learned how to use UnityEngine.Random number randomizer for cash earned.

Learned how to do timer with Time.deltaTime.

Learned to use Invoke

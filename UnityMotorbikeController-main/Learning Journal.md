I’ve started by researching bicycle/motorcycle physics assets because I want to do a delivery game prototype. I can add components such making deliveries, earning cash, timer and getting to certain locations to pick boxes etc. I've found a free online asset that contains a motorcycle physics asset/system which I am going to use and modify.

I want to make a delivery mission type of prototype where the player must go a given target destination to earn “points” or “money”. I can’t really find a tutorial for it so I will have to do it myself.

I will start this process by creating a script to spawn 3D cubes(areas) around the map to act as “delivery destinations”. This process will be carried out by the player clicking a button to get more deliveries.

Every time he gets to the delivery area, he will earn an extra point and the delivery area will be destroyed so he will have to click the button to create more deliveries for himself.

 
 

Here is the first part of my prototype working.

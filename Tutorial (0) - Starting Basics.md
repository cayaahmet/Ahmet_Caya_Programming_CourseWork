Creating the scene:
<br/><br/>
Here is the emppty scene we have

<br/><br/>
We need to add a plane that will act as our ground for the player. To do this right-click in the hierachy and select 3D Object>Plane

<br/><br/>
And then reset the transform and increase the xyz scale as 5,5,5 as shown in the picture

Great, now that we got the ground for our player we can finally put our player down. Grab the "MyMotorBike" prefab from the asset we downloaded and place it on top of the plane in the scene as shown down below in the picture:

And we want to delete the "Main Camera" that was included with the prefab

Instead we drag the "Main Camera" that we have in our scene to the prefab

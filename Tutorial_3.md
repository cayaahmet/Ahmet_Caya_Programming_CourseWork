# Tutorial 3
In this tutorial we are going to create a main menu, character selection screen. Create 2 character prefabs for the player to choose from which will be a "motorcycle" and a "taxi". We will also use "PlayerPrefs" to remember the player's character selection so that if the player presses "restart" or "retry" then the game will start over with the character that was selected last.

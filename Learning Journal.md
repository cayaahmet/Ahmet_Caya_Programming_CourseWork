I want to make a delivery simulation game with 2 characters; taxi and motorcyle. Iâ€™ve started by researching motorcycle controoler asset. I will add components such making deliveries, earning points, timer and getting to certain locations to get the points etc.
<br/><br/>
I've found an free online asset that contains a motorcycle controller asset which I am going to use and modify - https://github.com/ArcaDone/UnityMotorbikeController . I will only be using the motorcyle movement/controller script of this free asset. 
<br/><br/>

I discovered a neat tool in Unity that helps decide the amount of cash players earn randomly. This feature injected an element of surprise and excitement into the game, making it more enjoyable and unpredictable.
<br/><br/>
I also tackled the challenge of creating a timer using something called Time.deltaTime. This timer was super helpful because it allowed me to keep track of time within the game and control various actions and events, enhancing the overall gameplay experience.
<br/><br/>
Another exciting learning involved using Invoke to make things appear randomly on the game map. These "delivery points" pop up after a certain time and only a specific number of times, adding an extra layer of surprise and difficulty for the players.
<br/><br/>
Expanding the game's functionality, I successfully added essential screens like the Main Menu, Options, Character Selection, and Game Over screens. This made the game more user-friendly and easier to navigate, ensuring players can enjoy the game without any hassle.
<br/><br/>
Lastly, I explored PlayerPrefs, a Unity feature that allowed me to save and display the best scores achieved by players. This addition added a competitive edge to the game, giving players a goal to strive for and making the overall gaming experience more engaging and exciting.

I want to make a delivery simulation game with 2 characters; taxi and motorcyle. Iâ€™ve started by researching motorcycle controoler asset. I will add components such making deliveries, earning points, timer and getting to certain locations to get the points etc.

I've found an free online asset that contains a motorcycle controller asset which I am going to use and modify - https://github.com/ArcaDone/UnityMotorbikeController . I will only be using the motorcyel movement/controller script of this free asset.





Learned how to use UnityEngine.Random number randomizer for cash earned

Learned how to do timer with Time.deltaTime

Learned how to use Invoke to spawn "delivery points" at random points of the map with timer delay and max limit of spawns

Added Main Menu, Options, Character Selection Screen and Game Over Screen

Learned how to save the "High Score" of the player with PlayerPrefs




Throughout my game development journey, I've delved into various aspects of Unity that have significantly expanded my skills. One of the key learnings involved mastering the utilization of UnityEngine.Random number randomizer for managing cash earned within the game. Understanding how to effectively implement this randomizer not only enhanced the gameplay mechanics but also added an element of unpredictability, making the game more engaging. Additionally, getting a grasp on implementing a timer using Time.deltaTime was crucial. This timer functionality not only provided a means to track time within the game but also allowed for precise control and synchronization of various in-game events.

Another milestone was achieved by learning the intricacies of using Invoke to spawn "delivery points" dynamically across the map. This entailed setting up a system that generates these points at random locations while incorporating timer delays and maximum spawn limits, enriching the gameplay with spontaneity and challenges. Moreover, I successfully integrated essential screens like the Main Menu, Options, Character Selection, and Game Over screens. These additions not only improve the game's accessibility but also contribute to a more polished and user-friendly experience for players.

Lastly, mastering the implementation of PlayerPrefs to store and manage the player's "High Score" was a crucial aspect of my progress. Being able to save and retrieve the high score provides players with a tangible goal to strive for and adds a layer of competitiveness to the gameplay experience. Overall, each of these accomplishments has not only expanded my technical knowledge but has also significantly enriched the gameplay dynamics and user experience within the game.

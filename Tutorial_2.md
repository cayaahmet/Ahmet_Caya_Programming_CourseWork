# Tutorial 2
In this tutorial we are going to create a points and a timer system. Also "Game Over Screen" when the timer runs out. The points will go up every time a player collect a delivery point. Both the points system and timer system will have to be linked with UI and show up in the players game view to show them their points and how much time they have left. Every time the player collects a delivery point he will gain extra time. We will also do a High Score for the points, we will use PlayerPrefs for this. Therefore, the high score of the player will never go away and it will update every time that it is beaten.

We will start by creating our canvas for all of the UI we will need. To do so right-click the hierarchy and select UI>Canvas.

Now in our canvas we will start creating all the UI text that we will need. Here is how that will look.

It's just a bunch of UI>Text and UI>Background to get this look that we need. After doing so we will start creating the 2 scripts that we need.

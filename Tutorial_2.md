# Tutorial 2
In this tutorial we are going to create a points and a timer system. Also "Game Over Screen" when the timer runs out. The points will go up every time a player collect a delivery point. Both the points system and timer system will have to be linked with UI and show up in the players game view to show them their points and how much time they have left. Every time the player collects a delivery point he will gain extra time. We will also do a High Score for the points, we will use PlayerPrefs for this. Therefore, the high score of the player will never go away and it will update every time that it is beaten.
<br/><br/>
We will start by creating our canvas for all of the UI we will need. To do so right-click the hierarchy and select UI>Canvas.

<br/><br/>
Now in our canvas we will start creating all the UI text that we will need. 
<br/><br/>
It's just a bunch of UI>Text and UI>Background to get this look that we need. Create 2 empty game objects and call it "PointsUI" and "TimerUI", also 2 Text UIs are seperate from these game objects and name them "RewardText" and "RewardText1".
<br/><br/>
In the "PointsUI" game object that we created we have to create 2 image backgrounds and 5 Text UIs for points text, deliviries text and high score text. Seperate the "Points:" and "0" as the "0" will increase as the player collects delivery points and will be controlled by the script whereas the "Points:" will always stay the same. Do the same for "Deliviries Text:" and it's number ("0") as well as the "High Score:" and it's "0". 
<br/><br/>
For the "RewardText" and "RewardText1" write "Time increased" and "Well done" in their text as these will act us reward pop ups to give the player a sense of achivement when they collect a delivery as well as make them earn more time.
<br/><br/>
Here is how that will look.

<br/><br/>
After doing so we will start creating the 2 scripts that we need.
<br/><br/>
Now create 2 C# scripts one called "PointsSystem" and the other called "TimerUI".
<br/><br/>
![image](https://github.com/cayaahmet/Ahmet_Caya_Programming_CourseWork/assets/125205290/75474ae4-b38c-43aa-bc2b-c36c6afd10a0)
<br/><br/>
We will start with our "PointsSystem" script. Here are the namespaces we will need on the top of our script:
![image](https://github.com/cayaahmet/Ahmet_Caya_Programming_CourseWork/assets/125205290/2a9091b8-6ad2-4154-b41c-7b1ca48cea69)
<br/><br/>
Now copy all of these variables and functions which we will need for our systems to function.
![image](https://github.com/cayaahmet/Ahmet_Caya_Programming_CourseWork/assets/125205290/090ab406-e4a5-4828-b21a-41eaa541cb1a)
![image](https://github.com/cayaahmet/Ahmet_Caya_Programming_CourseWork/assets/125205290/29b16047-9aa9-495d-b200-2625d6f4aab2)
<br/><br/>
That's it for our "PointsSystem" script and now we will move on to our "TimerUI" script.
<br/><br/>
Here are the namespaces we will need for this script:
<br/><br/>
![image](https://github.com/cayaahmet/Ahmet_Caya_Programming_CourseWork/assets/125205290/f7a271d9-2360-431a-8cc6-ac6ccc31b922)
<br/><br/>
This time we will also use "UnityEngine.SceneManagement" as we will do a "Game Over Screen" for the player when the timer ends so that the player can choose to back to main menu or restart the level.
<br/><br/>
Here is our public class for our timer system script:
![image](https://github.com/cayaahmet/Ahmet_Caya_Programming_CourseWork/assets/125205290/193e4646-8058-469b-9e7b-d24f2534ea50)
We also have some extra code in there that we will use shortly for our "Game Over Screen".
<br/><br/>
And now lets go back to our scene as we have to attach the stuff that we have referenced in the script for the system to work.
<br/><br/>
Attach the "PointsSystem" to our player. And drag and drop the references that the script is asking for from our Canvas.
![image](https://github.com/cayaahmet/Ahmet_Caya_Programming_CourseWork/assets/125205290/bf57fdf5-4836-4414-b7a3-6b949c4219e1)
<br/><br/>
And for our "TimerUI" script, we will attach that to the "TimerUI" empty game object that we've created in the canvas:
![image](https://github.com/cayaahmet/Ahmet_Caya_Programming_CourseWork/assets/125205290/11643e88-1874-4b50-bd06-4a5cdcfd07f9)
You can leave the "Game Over UI" game object variable and "Pause UI Parent" game object variable empty for now as we will use them when we create our game over screen and pause system.
<br/><br/>
Now before we try to see if our system works we have to some stuff for our player and the delivery point for the system to work and function without any problems.
<br/><br/>
Firstly we need to create a box collider for our player:
<br/><br/>
![image](https://github.com/cayaahmet/Ahmet_Caya_Programming_CourseWork/assets/125205290/4d884259-c565-46dd-85d2-111c791cc3d8)
<br/><br/>
![image](https://github.com/cayaahmet/Ahmet_Caya_Programming_CourseWork/assets/125205290/04b6f39f-b71e-4ddf-adfa-c9a864ab2228)
<br/><br/>
That size or a similar size will do fine, just make sure that the collider is not touching the floor.
<br/><br/>
After that we will assign our player the tag "Player" in the inspector.
<br/><br/>
![image](https://github.com/cayaahmet/Ahmet_Caya_Programming_CourseWork/assets/125205290/4215836b-29c8-4ff1-be4b-84e8ab171717)
<br/><br/>
And do the same for our "DeliveryPointPrefab" and create a new tag called "Points".
![image](https://github.com/cayaahmet/Ahmet_Caya_Programming_CourseWork/assets/125205290/dc4fbef1-75fc-4784-bc03-b0a2e814502b)

<br/><br/>
Now we go and try our play mode to make sure everything is working fine.
![image](https://github.com/cayaahmet/Ahmet_Caya_Programming_CourseWork/assets/125205290/60ae150e-7bc7-4eb4-acac-3ba8e93cce45)
<br/><br/>
And yeah everything is working perfectly apart from the 2 errors we are getting that are for the "PauseUI" and "Game Over Screen" that we will work on now. We will do the pause system and PauseUI in the 4th tutorial. However, the game will still work fine without any problems. Now lets do our "Game Over Screen" for our player.
<br/><br/>
![image](https://github.com/cayaahmet/Ahmet_Caya_Programming_CourseWork/assets/125205290/b104ef9c-fd9b-4a8c-8020-1ffb1b911e68)
<br/><br/>
So, let's start creating our game over screen in the canvas.
<br/><br/>
Let's start by creating a empty game object called "GameOverUI" in our Canvas:
<br/><br/>
Add one background that will cover the whole screen, one text for the "Game Over" text and then 2 buttons one for "retry" which will act as the as the restart button and then one to go to the main menu.

<br/><br/>
Now we can assign the references to our "TimerUI" script in the "TimerUI" game object in the canvas:

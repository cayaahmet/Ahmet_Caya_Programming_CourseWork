# Tutorial 4
In this tutorial we are going to create a pause menu and that will be the end of tutorial series and also our prototype game! 
<br/><br/>
Now let's start.
<br/><br/>
In our game scene canvas, start by creating an empty game object called "PauseUIParent" and create a child called "PauseUI"
<br/><br/>
Create a image background and make it black. We will need 1 text UI for the "Options" text and then 3 buttons which we will need to resume, restart or go back to the main menu.

<br/><br/>
After having the pause ui system ready in canvas, create a script called "PauseUI".
<br/><br/>
We will need these namespaces for our script as we will need to access the UI and the scene management.
